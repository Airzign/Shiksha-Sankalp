	<div class="innertitle">Learning Rewards Model</div>
	<p class="innertext">
	  Shiksha Sankalp has developed a unique approach called the
	  <i>"Learning Rewards Model"</i>
	  to address the challenge of school education for poor students.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  Under this approach, Shiksha Sankalp encourages children from poor
	  families in the target community to enroll in government recognized
	  schools. Their learning achievement is tested through the
	  <i>Standardized Academic Performance (SAP)</i>
	  Tests conducted every four months by Shiksha Sankalp. Students are
	  provided monthly cash stipends
	  <i>(Learning Rewards)</i>
	  commensurate with their grade appropriate learning achievement. The
	  <i>learning rewards</i>
	  are transferred directly into their mother's bank account. With this the
	  students feel encouraged to learn actively at school.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  To address difficulties in learning at home (such as lack of guidance from
	  illiterate parents and poor learning environment), families enroll their
	  children at local private tuition centers and use the learning rewards
	  money to pay the fees. Many of these tuition centers are run by senior
	  school students from the same community or housewives from neighboring
	  middle class families.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  Many poor families also shift their children to private schools that
	  provide better education.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  Based on the SAP test performance, feedback is provided to the
	  participating students as well as to their schools and tuition centers.
	  This enhances accountability for learning achievement among all
	  stakeholders. Thus a new learning-focused ecosystem is created in the
	  community, where families actively respond to the learning requirements of
	  their children.
