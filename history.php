<h3><b>History</b></h3><br />

The Shiksha Sankalp project was conceptualized in early 2009 by a group of friends who wanted to contribute to addressing the challenge of universal school education in India. The friends committed themselves to try out some innovative ideas to address the challenge. They wanted to develop approaches which if piloted successfully would prove to be sustainable, scalable and replicable by design.  
<br /><br />
The friends tapped into various sector experts including development economists from the World Bank, academicians from Harvard University, several practicing NGO experts and various education experts. Based on the discussions with these people, the friends devised the Shiksha Sankalp model.  
<br /><br />
What emerged was a demand side model based on conditional cash transfers to students from low income families against demonstrated academic performance verified through a standardized test of learning achievement. The model would leverage contributions from Indians all over the world by generating trust through high levels of transparency and performance accountability.  
<br /><br />
<b>However, there were two key gaps in the model:</b>
<br /><br />
(i) whether the incentives would prove appropriate and adequate for bringing about a quantum change in learning achievement of poor children, and
<br /><br />
(ii) whether there would be enough interest from individual donors to be able to scale up this model going forward.  
<br /><br />
The friends realized that the proof of the pudding was in the eating. So, they decided to test pilot the model. The test pilots are currently under preparation and would be launched in August 2010 at three locations - an urban slum, a peri-urban village and a remote village.  
<br /><br />
The group of friends now looks forward to support from Indians all over the world in realizing the dream of a universally educated India.
