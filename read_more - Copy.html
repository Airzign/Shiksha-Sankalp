	  <body class="c7"><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c6">*(Editing in process)*</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In recent years, we have been spending a lot on primary education. We have launched Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, we are bulidng more schools, hiring more teachers and doing so much to augment the supply. But the problem might lie somewhere else. We need to ask different questions and see things from different perspective.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Education is the only real solution to poverty. Poor understand that. Yet, in spite of primary education being free, they don&#39;t feel like sending their children to school.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here is the problem :</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><img src="images/image04.png" width="626" height="343" align="middle"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><img height="338" src="images/image00.png" width="570"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4"> &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Child labour, poor quality of education, and illiteracy of the parents are some of the reasons why so many children </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">are still not going to schools. Simply said, even free education isn&rsquo;t a good investment for the poor in short term. What </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">we need to address the situation is a new way of thinking. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="392" src="images/image02.png" width="605"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"> &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So the challenge is to create the demand for primary education for poor. For that we need to address two aspects : Covering opportunity costs so that families, which already live hand to mouth, do not crumble under financial burden as children shift to schools; and ensuring that quality education is imparted so that education remains meaningful and valuable for the family. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shiksha Sankalp is working on a model that targets both these aspects together. It is working with poor families to make education a reality for their children. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So here is what we plan to do : </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="449" src="images/image03.png" width="662"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The solution is here in this simple model : Provide scholarships to children to continue education. So if a child is learning, she will be financially assisted by Shiksha Sankalp to continue her education. This scheme provides incentives and facilitates not just school education, but quality education. Once a child brings income to his family, the family can invest more into child&rsquo;s education. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="314" src="images/image06.png" width="594"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To ensure quality, Shiksha Sankalp conducts independent test called &lsquo;Annual Standardized Academic Performance Tests&rsquo; (ASAP). These are specially designed tests to measure the impact education has created. Performance in the ASAP test is used to determine the amount to be paid to the family. At the same time, Shiksha Sankalp keeps tracks of student&rsquo;s performance and regularity in school. It provides guidance to families on how they can enhance learning through greater attention to studies, better books, tuition, make-up classes, peer-to-peer learning and by demanding better teaching at school. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that is where you come in. As you donate and sponsor a child&rsquo;s education through Shiksha Sankalp, you do so many good things :</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">1. </span><img height="482" src="images/image01.png" width="618"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="427" src="images/image05.png" width="634"></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a donor you can be assured of the impact you are creating. You will be able to track your donations to the last penny by logging onto Shiksha Sankalp website and see how your money is being used. You can even keep a track of the academic performance of the children you are supporting and see how they improve over time with your assistance. At our end, we will ensure that every information is correctly verified and organized. All documents will be shared with donors and other stake holders so that 100% transparency is maintained. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So come, let us together change things and create a bright and beautiful future. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html> -->
