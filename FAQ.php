<!-- The content for FAQ's -->

<h3 class="question">1. Why does Shiksha Sankalp incentivize students rather than opening more schools?</h3>

<p class="answer">At Shiksha Sankalp we believe that poor educational outcomes are largely a result of demand side constraints and not supply side constraints. Poor families find it difficult to afford the overheads of educating their children even when schooling is provided free of cost by the government.Therefore, we aim at incentivizing students while leveraging the existing network of schools.</p>

<h3 class="question">2. How does Shiksha Sankalp decide the incentive amount for a child?</h3>

<p class="answer">The incentive amount for a child enrolled into the Shiksha Sankalp program is determined based on performance in the ASAP-test in accordance with a Performance-Incentive vector. 
The Performance Incentive Vector (PIV) is a mathematical function or a chart/graph that relates the amount of incentive to be provided to a student with his/her performance in the Annual Standardized Academic Performance (ASAP) Test.
</p>

<h3 class="question">3. Do performance incentives put psychological pressure on young minds?</h3>

<p class="answer">Performance incentives put the responsibility on students and their families to take education seriously and work towards better academic performance.  Although they add to the psychological pressure on young minds, we believe that the pressure is much lesser than that experienced by middle class children in urban private schools in India. The Shiksha Sankalp model is aimed at inculcating the values of hard work, self respect and meritocracy among students and their families.</p>

<h3 class="question">4. Is the Shiksha Sankalp model scalable? </h3>
<p class="answer">This model is highly scalable as it is much less effort and management bandwidth intensive than opening and operating schools. Also, the Shiksha Sankalp model is structured into modules, and can be easily scaled-up by opening more and more modules.</p>

<h3  class="question">5. Is the Shiksha Sankalp model cost effective? </h3>
<p class="answer">Shiksha Sankalp is a very cost effective model. It leverages existing schools infrastructure and other education opportunities available to students and families by incentivizing focus on improving academic performance.

Shiksha Sankalp uses the donations to pay:
<ul>
    <li>Incentives for students</li>
    <li>Incentives for teachers</li>
    <li>administrative expenses</li>
</ul>
Balancing Account: Shiksha Sankalp collects a fixed monthly subscription amount from all donors, regardless of the actual incentive amount paid to the sponsored student based on performance in the ASAP-Test. Therefore, a part of the donor subscription may remain unutilized each month. Such amount is transferred to a Balancing Account, which is separate for each donor.
</div>

<h3  class="question">17. What is the need to have a balancing account ?</h3>
<p class="answer">
The Balancing Account serves as a reserve for higher incentive payment in the future on account of (i) better student performance in the next ASAP-Test, (ii) annual inflation compensation, and (iii) higher incentive amounts for senior classes. It allows a fixed donor subscription amount to be collected for several years before an upward revision is necessitated.
</p>

<h3  class="question">18. Is it safe to give my credit card details online?</h3>
<p class="answer">The payment gateway is being developed by a team of web developers and cyber security experts to ensure that your details are guarded by a foolproof method. </p>

<p class="answer">After you make a donation, you will be made available the periodic ASAP test (standardized performance assessment )results of the student that you have sponsered on your email  account. Further, Shiksha Sankalp shall provide a personal account to each donor accessible through a unique username and password. Through this account, donors will be able to access scanned copies of ASAP tests, attendance details and other relevant performance parameters of the child they are sponsoring.</p>

<h3  class="question">20. Will the donation help me in securing a tax break?</h3>
<p class="answer">We are in the process of registering the organisation under section 80G of the Income Tax Act to obtain tax exemption for our donors.</p>
