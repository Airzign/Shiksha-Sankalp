	    <p class="question">1. Why does Shiksha Sankalp incentivize students rather than opening more schools?</p>
	    <p class="answer">
	      At Shiksha Sankalp we believe that poor educational outcomes are largely a result of demand side constraints
	      and not supply side constraints. Poor families find it difficult to afford the overheads of educating their
	      children even when schooling is provided free of cost by the government.Therefore, we aim at incentivizing
	      students while leveraging the existing network of schools.
	    </p>

		<p class="question">2. How does Shiksha Sankalp decide the incentive amount for a child?</p>
	    <p class="answer">
	      The incentive amount for a child enrolled into the Shiksha Sankalp program is determined based
	      on performance in the ASAP-test in accordance with a Performance-Incentive vector. The Performance Incentive
	      Vector (PIV) is a mathematical function or a chart/graph that relates the amount of incentive to be provided
		  to a student with his/her performance in the Annual Standardized Academic Performance (ASAP) Test.
		</p>

		<p class="question">3. Do performance incentives put psychological pressure on young minds?</p>
		<p class="answer">
		  Performance incentives put the responsibility on students and their families to take education seriously and
		  work towards better academic performance.  Although they add to the psychological pressure on young minds, we
		  believe that the pressure is much lesser than that experienced by middle class children in urban private
		  schools in India. The Shiksha Sankalp model is aimed at inculcating the values of hard work, self respect and
		  meritocracy among students and their families.
		</p>

		<p class="question">4. Is the Shiksha Sankalp model scalable? </p>
		<p class="answer">
		  This model is highly scalable as it is much less effort and management bandwidth intensive than opening and
		  operating schools. Also, the Shiksha Sankalp model is structured into modules, and can be easily scaled-up by
		  opening more and more modules.
		</p>

		<p  class="question">5. Is the Shiksha Sankalp model cost effective? </p>
		<p class="answer">
		  Shiksha Sankalp is a very cost effective model. It leverages existing schools infrastructure and other
		  education opportunities available to students and families by incentivizing focus on improving academic
		  performance. Shiksha Sankalp has adopted a direct cash transfer mechanism for delivery of incentives to poor
	      families because it s economically most efficient. Further, the Shiksha Sankalp model requires minimal
	      administrative overheads and maximizes the delivery efficiency of donor contributions.
	    </p>

		<p  class="question">6. How does Shiksha Sankalp lead to women's empowerment? </p>
	    <p class="answer">
	      The Shiksha Sankalp model enhances the financial strength of the lady of the house by opening a bank account
	      for her and transfering the monetary incentives into that very account
	    </p>

		<p  class="question">7. How can you contribute to the Shiksha Sankalp initiative? </p>
	    <p class="answer">
	      You can contribute to the Shiksha Sankalp initiative as a donor, a volunteer, a member or as an employee.
	      Of course, other stakeholders such as students, parents, teachers, school administrators and people working
	      with other NGOs also contribute to the Shiksha Sankalp initiative in their respective roles.
	    </p>

		<p  class="question">8. How does Shiksha Sankalp ensure complete transparency? </p>
	    <ul class="answer">

		<p  class="question">10. Does Shiksha Sankalp run schools or tuition centers?</p>
	    <p class="answer">No. Shiksha Sankalp does not run schools or tuition centers. However, by providing

		<p  class="question">16. How does shiksha sankalp use donor contributions?</p>
		<div class="answer">
		  Shiksha Sankalp uses the donations to pay:
		  <ul>
			<li>Incentives for students</li>
			<li>Incentives for teachers</li>
			<li>administrative expenses</li>
		  </ul>
		  Balancing Account: Shiksha Sankalp collects a fixed monthly subscription amount from all donors, regardless
		  of the actual incentive amount paid to the sponsored student based on performance in the ASAP-Test.
		  Therefore, a part of the donor subscription may remain unutilized each month. Such amount is transferred to
		  a Balancing Account, which is separate for each donor.
		</div>

		<p  class="question">17. What is the need to have a balancing account ?</p>
	    <p class="answer">
		  The Balancing Account serves as a reserve for higher incentive payment in the future on account of (i) better
		  student performance in the next ASAP-Test, (ii) annual inflation compensation, and (iii) higher incentive
		  amounts for senior classes. It allows a fixed donor subscription amount to be collected for several years
		  before an upward revision is necessitated.
		</p>

		<p  class="question">18. Is it safe to give my credit card details online?</p>
	  	<p class="answer">
		  The payment gateway is being developed by a team of web developers and cyber security experts to ensure
		  that your details are guarded by a foolproof method.
		</p>

		<p  class="question">19. What shall I get after I make a donation?</p>
	    <p class="answer">
		  After you make a donation, you will be made available the periodic ASAP test (standardized performance assessment )
		  results of the student that you have sponsered on your email  account. Further, Shiksha Sankalp shall
		  provide a personal account to each donor accessible through a unique username and password. Through this account,
		  donors will be able to access scanned copies of ASAP tests, attendance details and other relevant performance
		  parameters of the child they are sponsoring.
		</p>

		<p  class="question">20. Will the donation help me in securing a tax break?</p>
	    <p class="answer">
