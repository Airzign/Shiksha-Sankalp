    <div class="innertitle">Design Principles</div>
    <div style="padding-right:20px;">
      <p class="innertext">
	The fundamental principles underlying the design of the Shiksha Sankalp
	model are:
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	1.
	<b>Demand Side Incentives based on Demonstrated Outcomes</b>
	<br/>
	Performance based demand-side incentives put responsibility on students
	and families to take education seriously and work towards better academic
	performance.
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	2.
	<b>Direct Cash Transfers to Eligible Families</b>
	<br/>
	At Shiksha Sankalp, we believe direct cash transfers are the most
	economically efficient means to deliver donor support to eligible
	beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	3.
	<b>Leveraging Markets for Provision of Education Services</b>
	<br/>
	Shiksha Sankalp model encourages the development of market mechanisms for
	provision of educational services such as private schools, tuition
	centers, reading/arithmetic skill enhancement initiatives and peer-to-peer
	learning which complement the government school system to enhance learning
	outcomes.
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	4.
	<b>Sustainable, Scalable and Replicable Interventions</b>
	<br/>
	Given the magnitude of education challenge in India and other developing
	countries, Shiksha Sankalp model has been designed to be sustainable,
	scalable and replicable.
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	5.
	<b>Transparency and Performance Accountability to Foster Trust</b>
	<br/>
	The Learning Rewards model incorporates several checks and procedures to
	foster performance accountability. We adhere to highest standards of
	transparency by proactively disclosing all relevant information to
	respective stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p class="innertext">
	6.
	<b>Empowering Women for a Better Society</b>
	<br/>
	Financial empowerment of women and enabling them to make educational
	decisions for their children has a far-reaching effect on the wider
	society. Also, higher performance incentives for girls provide them a
	greater encouragement to study.
