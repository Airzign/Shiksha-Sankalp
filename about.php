	<div style="padding-right:20px;">
	<p class="innertext">
	  "Shiksha Sankalp" in Sanskrit means "Resolve for Education".  As the name
	  itself indicates, Shiksha Sankalp is an effort to ensure that every
	  under-privileged child in the world achieves age-appropriate level of
	  academic knowledge and skills.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  At Shiksha Sankalp, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the
	  complex barriers that prevent poor families in developing countries from
	  obtaining effective school education for their children. We understand why
	  nearly half of primary school students in India are unable to read a
	  simple grade-2 text. And why two of every three children in India drop-out
	  of school by middle grades. We find that the inability of poor students to
	  learn has its roots much beyond the quality of education at school. It
	  stems largely from the socio-economic condition of their families. School
	  education is a losing proposition for poor families and it does not make
	  economic sense for poor families to invest time, effort and money into the
	  education of their children.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  The challenge of universal and effective school education is important,
	  complex and urgent. At Shiksha Sankalp we know what it would take to
	  spread effective education to millions of poor children within a short
	  period of time.
	</p>
	<p class="innertext">
	  To meet the challenge of universal education in India,
	  <i>Shiksha Sankalp Foundation (SSF)</i>
	  has been set-up as a Trust. The foundation has applied for registration
	  with Income Tax Department for exemption from taxes under sections 12A and
	  80G of the Income Tax Act. Further, it is also applying for FCRA clearance
	  for receiving donor funds from abroad.
	</p>

	  In the USA,
	  <i>Shiksha Sankalp Incorporated (SSI)</i>
	  has been set-up as a nonprofit public benefit corporation registered with
	  the office of Secretary of State of the state of California. It has been
	  approved for exemption from tax in the United States under Section
	  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The mandate of SSI is to promote
	  school education in all developing countries, though initially it is
	  focused on India where it coordinates efforts with SSF.
